# WordStatistics: Hash Table Text Parser

## Overview

The **WordStatistics** repository implements a **Hash Table data structure** in Java, designed to parse and organize text from input files. The Hash Table supports all standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and access. After parsing the input text, the data structure is used to provide meaningful statistics about the text, such as word frequency and occurrence patterns.

## Key Features

- **Hash Table Implementation**: A fully functioning Hash Table data structure with support for standard operations.
- **Text Parsing**: Efficiently parses input text files and organizes the content using the Hash Table.
- **Text Statistics**: Provides various statistics on the input text, such as word frequency and other relevant metrics.
- **Java-Based**: Written entirely in Java, leveraging efficient hashing algorithms to manage large datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java, using object-oriented programming principles and custom hashing techniques.
